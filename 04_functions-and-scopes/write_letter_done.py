# Define a function called `write_letter()` that takes as input a `name`
# and a `text` argument. In the body of the function, create a greeting
# message with the `name` input, as well as a goodbye message that uses
# the `name` again. Combine that with the input `text` to return a
# complete `letter`.

def write_letter(name, text):
    print(f"Hi {name}.")
    print(f"Bye {name}. {text}")

#write_letter("James" ,"See you later.")
